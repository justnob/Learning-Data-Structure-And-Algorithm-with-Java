rule1 any assignment statements and if statement the are executed once regardless of the size of the problem  O(1)

rule3 a nested loop of the same type takes quadratic time complexity O(n^2)

rule4 a loop, in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step O(log n)

rule5 when dealing with multiple statements, just add them up
